Hey,
This is my personal blog and I usually write about Go programming language.
Most of the articles are written for myself to recap the topics that I did not understand.

# About me

I am an engineer who has a passion of writing Go code.
However, I am also interested in programming in C, Python, JavaScript and Clojure.

In my spare time I learn algorithms and contribute to opensource projects.
