Hey!

This is my personal blog and I usually write about Go programming language and algorithms.
Most of the articles are written for myself to remember/understand the topics that I've not understood.

I am an software engineer who has a passion of writing Go code.
However, I am also interested in programming in C, Python, JavaScript and Clojure.

In my spare time I learn algorithms and contribute to opensource projects.

Feedbacks and suggestions are appreciated
